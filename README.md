# albumcomparisions
Python + R + Tableau project to identify and visualize differences between The 1975's oldest album (The 1975) and most recent album (A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships).

For these two albums in particular, the top three most distinguishing variables were:
  - energy
  - time signature
  - liveness
